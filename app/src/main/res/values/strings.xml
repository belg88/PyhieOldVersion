    <string name="daily_advice1">You probably heard the term “Top one percent”, it usually refers to the most wealthy people in our society.
        Now using this app will most likely not get you to be one of the wealthiest people in your society. But you could still be in the top one percent of most effective,
        stress free or successful people, and it’s not that hard.\n\n
        How? Well study after study showed that people with regular sleeping and eating patterns are less prone to stress, they are getting less tired and in general have more energy throughout the day.
        On top of that people who keep and follow a daily planner are more organised and more effective at what they do, and same goes for people who regularly clean and organise their living area.\n\n
        Did you know that only 22% of people in the United Kingdom sleep in regular patterns, less than 10% monitor their sleep times.
        Only about 28% of people have their food at the same time every day. About 18% clean and organise their living area regularly and about 10% keep a daily planner.
        So in total only about 1% - 2% of people will do all these things at the same time, and it is very likely that these people are the most effective and stress free around us.\n\n
        So by simply organising these simple activities into your daily habits, will put you into the “Top one percent”.

        Failure to do so will results in losing 10 points for each habit that you missed.</string>

    <string name="daily_advice2_title">Let sleep by your ally, not enemy.</string>
    <string name="daily_advice2">We spend one third of our lives asleep, it is a major indicator of our well being. Having a good night\'s sleep is essential to your health, same as a healthy diet and exercise.
        \n\nOn the other hand, having irregular sleeping patterns could cause sleep deprivation on a daily basis. When a person is deprived of sleep, he will get tired more quickly and will have difficulty maintaining focus. Your brain will recognize this as a dangerous behaviour, and will send stress signals to his body, making you even more prone to anxiety and stress attacks.
        \n\nIt has been proven many times that people who wake up and go to bed at the same time are more confident and less prone to stress and fatigue.
</string>
    <string name="daily_advice3_title">We are what we eat.</string>
    <string name="daily_advice3">Our well being is directly linked to what we consume. It is not a secret to anyone that consuming good food is essential for our health. But in our daily lives it can be difficult to keep track of what we eat, this is why it is good to develop your own eating schedule.
        \n\nConsuming and digesting food is a difficult and complex process, having food at the same time every day will get our body more efficient at getting through this process. It is like a sort of training, when we do things at the time our body is expecting to do it, it will do it more efficiently.
        \n\nMaintaining healthy eating habits will help you be more energetic and less prone to stress.
